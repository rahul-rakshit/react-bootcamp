# Hello World Kata

## About

We'll be using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) to generate a react app starter for us. We'll then be modifying the generated source code to say "hello world".

##Â Instructions

1. Make sure you have `node.js` installed: `brew install node`
2. Create a react hello world repo: `npx create-react-app kata` and `cd kata` to go into the generated directory.
3. Modify the return statement in `./src/App.js` to return an HTML title that says "Hello, world!".
4. Run `npm start` to verify that "Hello, world!" indeed shows up in the browser.
