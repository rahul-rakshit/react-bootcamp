import React, { useState } from "react";

export function SampleApp() {

      I'm currently feeling:
      <h1>{currentMood}</h1>
      {/*
      Here we pass the event handler to the button,
      just like we do it in HTML. Only one difference:
      React likes camelCase for component props. */}
      <button onClick={toggleMood}>{actionText}</button>
    </>
  );
}
