# Props Exercise

## About

What is a React component? It is simply a function that may take some arguments (called props) and returns jsx. In this exercise, you'll write a React component that takes props.

##Â Instructions

1. Modify the function in `src/App.js`. It should take an object of just one prop - `name`. And it should return a heading (h1 or similar) that says "Hello, [name]!".
2. Run the tests by running `npm test`.
3. Modify the name in `index.js` to be your name.
4. Run `npm start` to run the app and verify that your name shows up in the browser.
